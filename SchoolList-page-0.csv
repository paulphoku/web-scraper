As an independent school of excellence, it has a pivotal role to play in both raising the level of education throughout the nation, and serving the community. We believe that our learners will go out into the world and spread their influence as ambassadors of our great nation.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/fleurhof-campus/Halite Road, Hyacinth Rd, Fleurhof, Randburg, 1709, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayClosedSundayClosed

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals.

However, the fundamentals of coding are formally introduced in our Grade 0 learning communities as detailed below. Robotics in the Pre-Preparatory phase is a 'hands on' approach to learning, where students build and design simple mechanisms from their environment whilst 'learning through play' with Lego Simple Machines. Whilst building activities range from spinning tops to racing cars, skills learnt involve an integration of Mathematics, Science and Linguistics. Coding skills are promoted through the use of the Sphero Bolt - a robotic ball that can be programmed to manoeuvre through specific paths, whilst displaying colour and sound effects.Rallim Preparatory | Cape Town, Deerhurst Drive, Sunningdale, Cape Town, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning.

Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

have to different situations. Reading for enjoyment is a great achievement as they
begin to decode and comprehend. The emphasis remains on creativity, sensory
exploration and individual interpretation.Grade 2In Grade 2 students begin to master skills, developing greater independence and
more responsibility. Participation in group work allows students to negotiate and
share, learning and understanding the value of friendship and empathy.Grade 3Our Grade 3 students move beyond ‘learning-to-read’ and start ‘reading-to-learn’.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.

At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning. Educators create learning activities that are motivational, technology-rich, and aligned to the needs of 21st century learners. Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence. As an Apple Distinguished and Google Apps for Education school, we use both platforms to provide a unique teaching and learning experience. Learners are introduced to iPads in Grade R, progressing to the Apple 1:1 environment beginning in Grade 1 and continuing through to Grade 12. Each child's device becomes a personalised learning platform where its integration into learning and life becomes second nature. Throughout the College, learners engage in a variety of technology enriched activities through which they learn new concepts, practise and consolidate existing skills, create unique products, explore new ideas and pursue curiosities, engage in remediation and participate in enrichment.At Parklands College, educational technology and a high-tech collaborative environment has allowed our teachers to extend their lessons in innovative ways and encourage learners to develop global competencies by solving real world problems. Our teaching staff includes Apple and Google certified educators who share their expertise with colleagues, as well as teachers at other schools both locally and abroad.Programming is an essential digital literacy of the future, and design an essential skill. For this reason Robotics and Programming is a compulsory subject from Grade 1 to 8.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary – High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/pre-school//2 Wessel Ave, Lyndhurst, Johannesburg, 2192Monday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayClosedSundayClosed

They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/fleurhof-campus/Halite Road, Hyacinth Rd, Fleurhof, Randburg, 1709, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
