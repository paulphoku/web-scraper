competencies and character they may require to achieve their dreams and contribute to their local and global communities as 21st century women.
We prioritise staying abreast of the latest research on innovative education, but we also draw on the practical wisdom gained from a century and a half of institutional experience. DSG provides a safe, inclusive environment where girls can fearlessly
follow their curiosity and learn through discovery and critical thinking and even risk failure with no judgement and only learning as a consequence.
Therefore, we encourage girls to explore the full range of opportunities in academics, sports, the arts, culture, the outdoors, community engagement, travel and leadership.
Our classrooms, stages, sports fields, boarding houses, Chapel and The Monastery outdoor centre are among the vibrant spaces where highly qualified staff work tirelessly to bring out the best in every individual.Here the girls learn about the value of hard work, perseverance, collaboration, sustainability, social justice and delayed gratification.There is something magical about the lifestyle on the DSG campus, probably thanks to the historic architecture, leafy gardens and peaceful smalltown landscape surrounding it. Full-time boarding enables DSG girls to be astonishingly productive and fully immersed in school life. They learn to appreciate the rich diversity of their peers, which
builds resilience and strengthens values of respect, humility, compassion and friendship. Such a busy school life can take its toll and girls are therefore monitored and supported by a Wellness Team that includes the resident pastoral staff in every house,
Chaplain, San sisters, educational psychologist and biokineticist.
We are proud to be custodians of our unique heritage while extending the legacy of the DSG through inclusive, future-minded education, in keeping with our motto ‘En Avant!’.DSG Junior - Grade 4-7DSG Senior - Grade 8-12Worcester St, Grahamstown, Makhanda, 6139, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 4:30 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

These same principles are applied to this day. The original curriculum used wa provided by the School of Tomorrow's Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) system which taught learners to study individually at a pace suitable for their own ability and temperament. When the National Department of Education began to streamline the education system the board of Benoni Christian School, after consulting with parents, adopted the public school system's curriculum but added to it as the need arose. Since its inception, Benoni Christian School has had a 100 per cent matric pass rate. A number of learners have excelled at Mathematics Olympiads, resulting in offers of bursaries from American universities. The focus on smaller classes, and hence greater individual assistance, has the advantage that learners can be aided effectively to gain maximum benefit from such attention. From its humble beginnings of just five learners and one teacher, the school has grown to an average learner body of ninety students with a dedicated academic staff of seventeen. Ext 4, 5 Papawer St, Northmead, Benoni, 1501, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
