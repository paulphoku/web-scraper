Randburg Montessori's goal is to give its children an education that will prepare them to succeed both in primary school and in life, in a rapidly changing world.

Here, we share a commitment to a close partnership between home and school, and our innovative educational programme leads children to develop extraordinary levels of personal responsibility, independence, and self-confidence. Looking back to our beginnings, in January 2002, 5 children with eager and supportive parents became the first class of Randburg Montessori.

The property of the school has been rezoned by the Ekurhuleni Municipality for use as a school. The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria. Secondly, there were a number of previously disadvantaged families who want good schooling for their children.Kaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaKaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Piet Retief Christian Church grew & the church building was extended to seat 250. After a church split in 1987, the numbers dwindled down to 70 people. In December 1988, the Lord brought Pastor Leonard & Dagmar to the church & within a year, God restored each member to the congregation. By 1991, the church building had become too small & the leadership began purchasing properties adjacent to the current building, allowing space for the new proposed building.

Bellville,,stonefountain@connectedsa.co.za,,,https://saprivateschools.co.za/listing/stonefountain-college-bellville/,CAPS,,Bellville,Copy link,Copy link,7:00 am - 3:00 pm,"Stonefountain College was established in 2005. Its roots stem from The Al Kalam Educational Society, which served learners in an extra mural academic assistance programme. Learners were assisted with skills development especially with regards to numeracy and literacy. A drug monitoring policy was developed in 2005 and the Stonefountain learners were expected to subject themselves to regular drug testing. This policy of drug testing proved very useful for many of the learners tested, tested positive for drug use and this explained their lack of progress at school. With an improvement of over 90% in drug use, the performance of learners soared and great success was achieved. This drug policy caught the eye of the Minister of Education, Grace Naledi Pandor, and the college drug policy has since become the benchmark for similar policies at all public schools across the country. In 2010, Stonefountain opened its second campus in Kenilworth as demand at the Athlone campus surpassed the available facilities there. It is indeed stimulating that schools like Stonefountain have found a special educational niche. Schools like Stonefountain independent schools charging modest fees should be drawn on to assist innovation in public schools.26 Voortrekker Rd Standard Bank Building , South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
