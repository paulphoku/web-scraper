Our classes are limited to 15 children per age-group and, under our constant supervision, each child is helped to reach his or her full potential. Every child is assessed and bi-annual reports are sent to parents in June and November. This encourages parents and teachers to meet and discuss the child's progress. Varying weekly themes enable parents to become involved in the activities their children are busy with at school. These include art, movement, music, story and discussions, and education activities such as work books for the older children. All our teachers are qualified in educare and are trained in first-aid. Their first-aid training is renewed every two years.

Christine's field of expertise is primary school and Andrew's focus has been high school and tertiary education. They are both passionate about education.

There is no question that education is due a complete overhaul with a focus on skills rather than content.

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand.
