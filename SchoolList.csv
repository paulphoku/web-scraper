As an independent school of excellence, it has a pivotal role to play in both raising the level of education throughout the nation, and serving the community. We believe that our learners will go out into the world and spread their influence as ambassadors of our great nation.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/fleurhof-campus/Halite Road, Hyacinth Rd, Fleurhof, Randburg, 1709, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayClosedSundayClosed

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals.

However, the fundamentals of coding are formally introduced in our Grade 0 learning communities as detailed below. Robotics in the Pre-Preparatory phase is a 'hands on' approach to learning, where students build and design simple mechanisms from their environment whilst 'learning through play' with Lego Simple Machines. Whilst building activities range from spinning tops to racing cars, skills learnt involve an integration of Mathematics, Science and Linguistics. Coding skills are promoted through the use of the Sphero Bolt - a robotic ball that can be programmed to manoeuvre through specific paths, whilst displaying colour and sound effects.Rallim Preparatory | Cape Town, Deerhurst Drive, Sunningdale, Cape Town, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning.

Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

have to different situations. Reading for enjoyment is a great achievement as they
begin to decode and comprehend. The emphasis remains on creativity, sensory
exploration and individual interpretation.Grade 2In Grade 2 students begin to master skills, developing greater independence and
more responsibility. Participation in group work allows students to negotiate and
share, learning and understanding the value of friendship and empathy.Grade 3Our Grade 3 students move beyond ‘learning-to-read’ and start ‘reading-to-learn’.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.

At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning. Educators create learning activities that are motivational, technology-rich, and aligned to the needs of 21st century learners. Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence. As an Apple Distinguished and Google Apps for Education school, we use both platforms to provide a unique teaching and learning experience. Learners are introduced to iPads in Grade R, progressing to the Apple 1:1 environment beginning in Grade 1 and continuing through to Grade 12. Each child's device becomes a personalised learning platform where its integration into learning and life becomes second nature. Throughout the College, learners engage in a variety of technology enriched activities through which they learn new concepts, practise and consolidate existing skills, create unique products, explore new ideas and pursue curiosities, engage in remediation and participate in enrichment.At Parklands College, educational technology and a high-tech collaborative environment has allowed our teachers to extend their lessons in innovative ways and encourage learners to develop global competencies by solving real world problems. Our teaching staff includes Apple and Google certified educators who share their expertise with colleagues, as well as teachers at other schools both locally and abroad.Programming is an essential digital literacy of the future, and design an essential skill. For this reason Robotics and Programming is a compulsory subject from Grade 1 to 8.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary – High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/pre-school//2 Wessel Ave, Lyndhurst, Johannesburg, 2192Monday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayClosedSundayClosed

They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study.

A few years later in 1911, St Peter's Priory and College were added, offering a boarding-based high school education to the young men who came from the length and breadth of South Africa. It soon became known as the ""Black Eton"" where academic achievements were espoused. The list of the early alumni is impressive, the likes of Oliver Tambo, Fikile Bam and Hugh Masekela, as well as many of our former students, hold key positions in government and in large international corporations. The apartheid policies of the National Party regime put pressure on the school and it was closed in 1956.

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals. Every girl who has been a member of our school is known as a Rosie and is a part of the Rosie Family for life.Our VisionRooted in Christ's teaching of love for God, self and others, the family of St Teresa's School is committed to developing the values of compassion, service, love and respect in our girls. We aim to nurture and inspire responsible, enquiring young women who strive for excellence in all facets of life.18 Keyes Ave, Rosebank, Johannesburg, 2196, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning. Educators create learning activities that are motivational, technology-rich, and aligned to the needs of 21st century learners. Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

In order to achieve this, it is  Da Silva Academy’s policy to expose its pupils to the various disciplines offered by the School: scholarship, sportsmanship and culture.The School views each of these disciplines as inherently important and as complementary components of a balanced, holistic education. We do not take the view that academic work is the only success criteria in the School. Although there is an emphasis on academic discipline and achievement, the importance of a balanced life style encompassing physical activity and wellbeing, as well as cultural involvement is impressed upon the learners and to this end they are expected to participate in the full school programme.Da Silva Academy prides itself on developing the individuality of each of its children and is fortunate in having small numbers, which allows this concentration of attention.Da Silva Academy strives to instil an ethos of high self-esteem, self-respect and well behaviour in all its pupils. These qualities are vital to allow every child to be the best that they can be.Ethos is defined as the characteristic spirit of a community, people or system. Every member of the School’s community contributes their own special gifts to make the School unique.Individual teachers, learners, parents and support staff become touched by the atmosphere pervading our independent School and the longevity of service of some of the staff is explained by their devotion to this Rustenburg institution.Monday7:00 am - 3:30 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals. Every girl who has been a member of our school is known as a Rosie and is a part of the Rosie Family for life.Our VisionRooted in Christ's teaching of love for God, self and others, the family of St Teresa's School is committed to developing the values of compassion, service, love and respect in our girls.

A group of intrepid church members felt that they needed to start a pre-school to serve the wider community of Pietermaritzburg. NCF Church embraced the idea of formal education on its land and endeavoured to assist. After 10 years of running a pre-school it was decided by Mrs W Fath (the first principal) to open a primary school. Since the first Grade 1 class of 1999 the school has experienced much positive growth. Mr B Mouton became the second principal in 2004. With a growing school and adjacent church it was decided to focus mainly on pre-school and junior primary from 2006. Since 2006 the focus of this school was to grow qualitatively and partner with neighbouring schools. Over the years the school added classrooms, sports fields and a swimming pool to its facilities. In June 2014 the school changed its name and badge, becoming Maritzburg Preparatory School. The school focuses on a qualitative approach to its foundation phase, and aims to be known for its love for children and its dedication as a team (staff, learners and parents) to giving the best all-round early education. Maritzburg Preparatory School, Alexandra Road, Westgate, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand. Op 16 April 1996 open die skool met ongeveer 35 leerlinge op 'n perseel tussen Kempton Park en Benoni. Geboorte-en groeipyne spring die skool nie vry nie, maar ten spyte van diepliggende menslike verskille was daar tog die gevoel en baie sterk behoefte by ouers dat hulle graag hulle kinders in 'n privaatskool wil he, omdat die volgende waardes vir hulle belangrik is: Onderwerping aan die Skrif Kwaliteitonderrig Geborgenheid wat kleiner klassies meebring Gesonde dissipline Afrikaner-kultuurgebondenheid ?

The property of the school has been rezoned by the Ekurhuleni Municipality for use as a school. The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria. Secondly, there were a number of previously disadvantaged families who want good schooling for their children.Kaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaKaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Our evergreen campus on the gentle banks of the Piesang River, lies a few kilometres upstream from the landmark Beacon Isle Hotel in Plettenberg Bay. The sounds of laughter, music and sport fill the air. Between classes, High School students sit and work unsupervised, play chess on our giant outdoors board, practise music and basketball, or just unwind. Afternoons are a hive of activity, with soccer, hockey, netball, tennis or cricket taking place, depending on the term. Swimming, mountain biking, waterpolo and kayaking are also popular. The School runs from a toddler class, through Grades 000 - 12, and writes the Cambridge International Examinations. These equip students to enroll at universities overseas if they so wish (and, of course, at South African ones). We now also offer A-Levels. We are strong academically and pride ourselves on achieving some of the best Cambridge results in the country.

When the National Department of Education began to streamline the education system the board of Benoni Christian School, after consulting with parents, adopted the public school system's curriculum but added to it as the need arose. Since its inception, Benoni Christian School has had a 100 per cent matric pass rate. A number of learners have excelled at Mathematics Olympiads, resulting in offers of bursaries from American universities. The focus on smaller classes, and hence greater individual assistance, has the advantage that learners can be aided effectively to gain maximum benefit from such attention.

The Charismatic movement affected this group, opening the way for a free move of the Holy Spirit amongst those who attended. Land that housed an old barn was purchased & converted into a church hall & the first pastoral couple were called to minister. Piet Retief Christian Church grew & the church building was extended to seat 250. After a church split in 1987, the numbers dwindled down to 70 people. In December 1988, the Lord brought Pastor Leonard & Dagmar to the church & within a year, God restored each member to the congregation. By 1991, the church building had become too small & the leadership began purchasing properties adjacent to the current building, allowing space for the new proposed building. In August 1997, the new church building was opened- a complete faith project & entirely debt-free! In 2002, the new building was extended & the seating capacity enlarged to 900.

Its roots stem from The Al Kalam Educational Society, which served learners in an extra mural academic assistance programme. Learners were assisted with skills development especially with regards to numeracy and literacy. A drug monitoring policy was developed in 2005 and the Stonefountain learners were expected to subject themselves to regular drug testing. This policy of drug testing proved very useful for many of the learners tested, tested positive for drug use and this explained their lack of progress at school. With an improvement of over 90% in drug use, the performance of learners soared and great success was achieved. This drug policy caught the eye of the Minister of Education, Grace Naledi Pandor, and the college drug policy has since become the benchmark for similar policies at all public schools across the country. In 2010, Stonefountain opened its second campus in Kenilworth as demand at the Athlone campus surpassed the available facilities there. It is indeed stimulating that schools like Stonefountain have found a special educational niche.

We prioritise staying abreast of the latest research on innovative education, but we also draw on the practical wisdom gained from a century and a half of institutional experience. DSG provides a safe, inclusive environment where girls can fearlessly
follow their curiosity and learn through discovery and critical thinking and even risk failure with no judgement and only learning as a consequence.
Therefore, we encourage girls to explore the full range of opportunities in academics, sports, the arts, culture, the outdoors, community engagement, travel and leadership.
Our classrooms, stages, sports fields, boarding houses, Chapel and The Monastery outdoor centre are among the vibrant spaces where highly qualified staff work tirelessly to bring out the best in every individual.Here the girls learn about the value of hard work, perseverance, collaboration, sustainability, social justice and delayed gratification.There is something magical about the lifestyle on the DSG campus, probably thanks to the historic architecture, leafy gardens and peaceful smalltown landscape surrounding it. Full-time boarding enables DSG girls to be astonishingly productive and fully immersed in school life. They learn to appreciate the rich diversity of their peers, which
builds resilience and strengthens values of respect, humility, compassion and friendship. Such a busy school life can take its toll and girls are therefore monitored and supported by a Wellness Team that includes the resident pastoral staff in every house,

When the National Department of Education began to streamline the education system the board of Benoni Christian School, after consulting with parents, adopted the public school system's curriculum but added to it as the need arose. Since its inception, Benoni Christian School has had a 100 per cent matric pass rate.

When Herschel expanded and we had to find new premises, The Hill moved to the present location in Winchester Avenue, Bishopscourt, opposite Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden. Enthusiastic parents and hard work created the new building which has grown over the years into the existing successful and highly respected institution.
