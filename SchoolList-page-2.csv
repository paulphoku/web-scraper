After 10 years of running a pre-school it was decided by Mrs W Fath (the first principal) to open a primary school. Since the first Grade 1 class of 1999 the school has experienced much positive growth. Mr B Mouton became the second principal in 2004. With a growing school and adjacent church it was decided to focus mainly on pre-school and junior primary from 2006. Since 2006 the focus of this school was to grow qualitatively and partner with neighbouring schools. Over the years the school added classrooms, sports fields and a swimming pool to its facilities.
