Kimberley Christian School is a combined school offering classes from Grade R to Grade 12. We offer all the subjects that are offered by Government Schools, the difference being that the curriculum we use is based on Biblical values and Character building. We do not use a lock step program, but the learner learns to work at his/her own pace, working to achieve their goals for the day. The curriculum is thus Individualised, Self-paced and geared that the learner achieves Mastery over the work. We also offer After-care and facilities.

Our aim is to grow the strong points and nurture the weak points of each child as well as to integrate therapies into learning time. At SOWLE Centre we are followers of Jesus. We seek to show love, care and respect to everyone. We meet every challenge by growing and learning together. Sowle Centre began because of a little boy ready to enter reception year in January 2011. He has been diagnosed with Down syndrome and his parents were struggling to find an appropriately stimulating learning environment for him. Sowle Centre evolved because we quickly realised that children with various special needs could also receive quality schooling, thanks to the skills that we developed from giving quality education to children with Down Syndrome. Our school caters for children who do not ""fit"" into remedial education classes as they are most conventionally classified. This is because these children may be more than two years behind in their development, but the unique environment and curriculum at our school afford the children the ability to learn through hands-on activities and play, rather than mainstream ""paper-based"" learning.95a Boden Rd, Jatniel, Benoni, 1509, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 5:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 5:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
