The Charismatic movement affected this group, opening the way for a free move of the Holy Spirit amongst those who attended. Land that housed an old barn was purchased & converted into a church hall & the first pastoral couple were called to minister. Piet Retief Christian Church grew & the church building was extended to seat 250. After a church split in 1987, the numbers dwindled down to 70 people. In December 1988, the Lord brought Pastor Leonard & Dagmar to the church & within a year, God restored each member to the congregation. By 1991, the church building had become too small & the leadership began purchasing properties adjacent to the current building, allowing space for the new proposed building. In August 1997, the new church building was opened- a complete faith project & entirely debt-free! In 2002, the new building was extended & the seating capacity enlarged to 900.

Having acquired the knowledge of these truths, we trust that our learners will be used by God in their respective communities as catalysts of change and inspiration. Furthermore our responsibility encompasses the spiritual, intellectual, physical, social and emotional well-being of our learners. These areas are inseparable from one another as their threads permeate all areas of the learner's life. We strive to be student-oriented rather than textbook-oriented and base our foundation on the Word of God ensuring that the Scriptures are woven throughout the total curriculum and that the teachings of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour are understood. We encourage learners to use their God-given talents for His glory and provide platforms and opportunities to nurture and display these talents.Rabboni Christian School, Krokodildrift-Oos, Brits, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
