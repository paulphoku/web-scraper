The Redwood School ecosystem seeks to provide a vibrant learning environment for all learners – a place of shelter, a place called home, a place where individuals are valued, a place where values are essential, learning is central, and potential is released.
The brand mantra is BETTER TOGETHER and this is inferred from the idea of belonging to something greater than the sum of the parts.Redwood College applies innovative solutions which embrace blended learning. The benefits of eLearning are combined with traditional face-to-face teaching as well as self-paced learning schedules. This forward-thinking approach facilitates academic rigour whilst ensuring that each learner is able to master content. The result is motivated learners who are inspired to learn more.
Our teaching philosophy is built on the understanding that profound learning takes place through discovery, creativity and critical thinking. We create an environment that facilitates mastery through discovery and experience and ensures a personalised approach where learners can reach their own potential.34 Ronan Rd, La Lucia, Durban, 4051Monday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Learning for children is a rewarding and enjoyable experience in which they explore, investigate, discover, create , practice, rehearse and consolidate. If there is a stimulating environment, young children's learning will be enhanced. We strive to provide such an environment. Daylee creche opened its doors for the first time on 27 February 1995. The first child at Daylee was our own Darshan Lee Naidoo. The first three children were Sheldon Chetty, Theolan Govender and Sannya Rugbeer. Daylee catered for children from 2-5 years. It was slow going at first with just 3 children in our first month. Through word of mouth grew and grew and now in our 20th year we can proudly say we have 130 children from 4 months to 5 years. From 1998 we began enrolling babies and our first 3 babies were Santhen Rooy, Tristan Munthree and Danielle Chitradow.
