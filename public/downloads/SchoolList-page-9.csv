All other knowledge is built upon this foundation. Integrity of heart forms one of the cornerstones for the development of steadfast personal character. We place a high value on integrity and respect for others in all of our interactions, whether in word or deed. It is the golden thread which weaves through the moral fabric of our lives, our families and our communities. All progress depends on the constant desire for and pursuit of new thought. We understand that we are preparing our learners for future jobs that do not yet exist and because of this we believe in encouraging curiosity and creativity in the manner in which we learn, use technology, and collaborate with those around us We desire to see meaningful growth in the life of every individual we interact with.
