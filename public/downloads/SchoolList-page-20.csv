The School is thus an extension of the Church and its vision as determined from time to time. In light of the above, WITBANK CHRISTIAN ACADEMY has chosen to use the Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) system. This system is academically sound as it is based on each individual child's learning ability, which facilitates learning through self-instructional materials and is achievement-oriented and self-motivational. The School is part of the Church, its curriculum is in harmony with the Bible and its staff are born-again Christians. Since the school is not an arm of the Church but is the Church in action, the school falls under the pastoral authority of the Leadership of the Church. ? ?

The property of the school has been rezoned by the Ekurhuleni Municipality for use as a school. The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria.

In particular Wendon Academy caters for the holistic educational needs of children who have learning barriers and who are not able to flourish in alternate educational schooling systems. In this educational context many of these children may manifest academic, behaviour problems and a lack of social integration which results in their marginalization, both during their school career and beyond. Wendon Academy was opened in January 2003 after its founders, Donald and Wendy Hicks took the initiative to set up a holistic, caring and high quality educational environment that would meet the specific needs of children with special needs. Their journey to 2003 had been one of personal experience and much research that was driven by their need to find a suitable educational context for the children that enter Wendon Academy. Mission Statement The aim of Wendon Academy is to develop happy, thinking, caring pupils who are equipped with the necessary knowledge and life skills to cope as balanced and confident individuals in their communities.22 High Wycombe Rd, Dawncrest, Westville, 3629, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Waldorf curriculum is an integrated Primary and High School system with the developmental stages of the child being the basis upon which subjects are introduced. The Main Lesson, which takes place in the first two hours of the school day when the children are at their most attentive, provides an in-depth exploration of any given subject. Each main lesson block lasts approximately four weeks, during which time children learn to approach the topic using all of their senses, to feel, think and experience the subject, making it their own. Their enthusiasm for learning can be seen in the quality of the self-made books that each student creates for the main lessons. ? ?
