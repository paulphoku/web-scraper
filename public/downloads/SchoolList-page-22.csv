A group of intrepid church members felt that they needed to start a pre-school to serve the wider community of Pietermaritzburg. NCF Church embraced the idea of formal education on its land and endeavoured to assist. After 10 years of running a pre-school it was decided by Mrs W Fath (the first principal) to open a primary school. Since the first Grade 1 class of 1999 the school has experienced much positive growth. Mr B Mouton became the second principal in 2004. With a growing school and adjacent church it was decided to focus mainly on pre-school and junior primary from 2006. Since 2006 the focus of this school was to grow qualitatively and partner with neighbouring schools. Over the years the school added classrooms, sports fields and a swimming pool to its facilities. In June 2014 the school changed its name and badge, becoming Maritzburg Preparatory School. The school focuses on a qualitative approach to its foundation phase, and aims to be known for its love for children and its dedication as a team (staff, learners and parents) to giving the best all-round early education.Maritzburg Preparatory School, Alexandra Road, Westgate, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully.

We believe that all children are capable of teaching as well as learning, and we take cognisance of this in all our interactions with our students. Our focus, therefore, is on developing the individual, not in moulding them into the strictures of conformity or the traditions of an institution, expecting them to perform in areas they are clearly not suited to. Too often we have seen the breakdown of a child's self-esteem, the labels that are attached and the medication unnecessarily administered to keep a child from disrupting a class environment unable to nurture and contain them. We at Chartwell have a group of highly professional and dedicated teachers to help ensure that all students receive the attention they need to fulfil their true potential. ?88 5th Street Chartwell, Chartwell, 2055, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
