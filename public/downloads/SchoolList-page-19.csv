When children and teenagers feel safe and valued, they will excel and realise their God given potential. Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well. It is more resilient and is growing stronger. Here we refer to our pastoral care, academics, extra-murals, staff development, financial controls, marketing and administration, maintenance and upgrades to our facilities. We are encouraged by our steady enrolments for 2023. Most importantly, our school remains debt free.

We follow the National Early childhood Development curriculum and pride ourselves on nurturing and stimulating children at this crucial development period. The nature of teaching in the early years is unlike that of any other age group. Play forms the foundation of the Merry Days & Little Saints programme. In our play rich environment, your child will learn about themselves; learn what words to use when asking for something; How to climb a jungle gym; what primary & secondary colours are; Colours & Shapes; Days of the week & Months; How to be a friend. Play helps children define who they are and involves singing, creative activities, fantasy play and sharing. Play is therefore the cornerstone of learning, the foundation from which children venture fourth to investigate and test. Our loving and qualified teachers plan a curriculum, that includes play as a medium for learning and as children grow, they integrate and assimilate their play experiences. What starts out as play and sheer fun is transformed into learning experiences. Merry Days & Little Saints Preschool, Othello Drive, Fourways, Sandton, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Dr. Montessori initially worked with special needs children and was enormously successful in developing and applying teaching methods which aided their learning. Her educational methods were revolutionary in that they were based on the scientific observation of how children learnt. She did not merely impose traditional teaching methods which she felt restricted children realising their full potential. In particular the Montessori approach emphasises learning through all five senses and not only through the more traditional approaches of listening, watching and reading. Dr. Montessori's special needs children performed so successfully when they wrote the public school examinations that she subsequently founded a school in Rome called â€œCasa dei Bambiniâ€ (Children's House), where her teaching methods and principles were applied. Shortly thereafter two more Montessori schools were established and the word quickly spread about her successful teaching methods.7 Little Nook St, Sunningdale, Umhlanga, 4319, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

We limit the number of learners in each class to ensure that they get individual attention in exactly the places they need.Our learners also receive guidance when choosing their elective subjects at the end of Grade 9. From Grade 10, we prepare learners for the NSC exams in Grade 12. However, we focus on more than just assessments, by applying the work to real-life situations.
