We strongly urge all parents to ensure that their home language and culture is kept alive but ask that they assist us in our endeavours to teach English by supporting our insistence that only English (unless in the Afrikaans classes) is spoken at school. When making application for enrollment at our school parents of non-English speaking children should understand that in most cases it takes a child a full year to master the language of learning and teaching; usually resulting in the child having to repeat the academic year.Robert Carruthers School, Pierneef Avenue, Witbank, Emalahleni, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully. This is still the heart of Kyrios.

My passion is education and I have been involved in the profession for 32 years. I started out as a teacher at Klipspruit West Senior Secondary school. Being fairly young and new to the profession it taught me a lot about teaching and forming relationships with learners and parents. In 1997 I transferred to Turffontein Primary school, first as teacher and within two years I was promoted to Principal. It was an immense challenge for me since the new school was a previous model C school and also the first truly multicultural school in the south of Johannesburg. While challenging at first I soon realized it gave me an opportunity to develop critical managerial skills which helped me to build bridges with the staff and the Gauteng Department of Education, and with parents and other stakeholders of the school. During my time at Turffontein I felt privileged that I was able to create an exchange program with the UK Education Department through the British Council and I was invited to do a Master's programme in Educational Leadership at Harvard University in the USA.Ext 28, Cnr Tomato and, Kei St, Protea Glen, Soweto, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand.

Michaelhouse is a school of established heritage with an innate respect for the individual. It is this long held tradition that distinguishes Michaelhouse from other senior boys' schools. We believe that going to senior school is as much about finding one's niche in life as having the freedom and encouragement to explore it and to become the best one can be.

These same principles are applied to this day. The original curriculum used wa provided by the School of Tomorrow's Accelerated Christian Education (ACE) system which taught learners to study individually at a pace suitable for their own ability and temperament. When the National Department of Education began to streamline the education system the board of Benoni Christian School, after consulting with parents, adopted the public school system's curriculum but added to it as the need arose. Since its inception, Benoni Christian School has had a 100 per cent matric pass rate. A number of learners have excelled at Mathematics Olympiads, resulting in offers of bursaries from American universities. The focus on smaller classes, and hence greater individual assistance, has the advantage that learners can be aided effectively to gain maximum benefit from such attention. From its humble beginnings of just five learners and one teacher, the school has grown to an average learner body of ninety students with a dedicated academic staff of seventeen.Ext 4, 5 Papawer St, Northmead, Benoni, 1501, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
