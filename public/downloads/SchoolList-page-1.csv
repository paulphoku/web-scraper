With small class sizes, dedicated teachers, an enhanced curriculum and a strong focus on STEAMD and Robotics, we empower learners with 21st-century skills and knowledge to grow into high-performing, self-confident individuals, ready to become the leaders of the future. Foundation phase: 4 years to Grade 3Our foundation phase starts by providing the emotional and intellectual foundation required to handle the formal learning that starts in Grade 1. We then gradually develop learners' skills and knowledge in basic areas such as language (comprehension, speaking and listening), mathematics (counting and understanding numbers) and creative problem-solving, in an environment in which they enjoy being. Through our enhanced curriculum, learners are introduced to project-based learning and gain 21st-century skills through subjects such as Robotics (from Grade R), and with Sesotho and Afrikaans as additional language options.Intermediate phase: Grade 4 to Grade 7In these grades, learners are led into more abstract thought and independent work. Our small class sizes and dedicated teachers prepare them for high school by teaching them how to apply the 21st-century skills and concepts they have learned. As a Curro School, we also promote creativity and critical thinking by encouraging children to make their own choices within well-established boundaries. Our enhanced curriculum includes specialised subjects such as Information Technology and Robotics. Learners in this phase may use tablets in class to enhance their learning experience, and learners have the choice between Afrikaans or Sesotho as an additional language.Curro Bloemfontein activitiesWe believe that participation in sports and cultural activities plays an important role in developing a well-rounded learner and promoting friendship, team-awareness and self-confidence. Therefore, our wide range of activities is designed to help learners discover their inherent talents, or broaden their exposure beyond their current reference framework. Our extramural activities are offered by private tutors or coaches, at an additional cost. Some of these activities are aimed at boosting learners' cognitive abilities while others provide pure enjoyment. Academics - High SchoolCurro Bloemfontein is an independent high school in Groenvlei, Bloemfontein, that provides high-quality education for learners from Grade 8 to Grade 12. Our dedicated teachers and well-rounded approach prepare learners for the IEB examinations at the end of Grade 12. With small class sizes, dedicated teachers and an enhanced curriculum focusing on STEAMD, we empower learners with 21st-century skills and knowledge to grow into high-performing, self-confident individuals, ready to become the leaders of the future.Senior phase: Grade 8 and Grade 9In these grades, we guide learners to adjust to a greater workload of higher intensity. With dedicated teachers and affordable school fees, our enhanced approach places great emphasis on problem solving and individual thinking. Teaching in our small class sizes takes place in English, and learners gain 21st-century skills in all subjects, including Engineering Graphics and Design (EGD).FET phase: Grade 10 to Grade 12This phase prepares learners for the IEB examinations written at the end of Grade 12. However, we emphasise a greater world-readiness rather than a purely examinations-driven approach. Our learners are taught to think innovatively, express their ideas and take charge of their own lives - all highly-valued 21st-century skills. Furthermore, as a Curro School, 21st-century learning is implemented in all subjects, including specialised subjects such as Information Technology and Engineering Graphics and Design (EGD). Our learners also use e-books in class rather than textbooks for certain subjects.We use e-books in classAs a Curro School, our high-school learners use personal computers or e-books in class rather than textbooks. Printed textbooks may be purchased at an additional cost. By exposing learners in our small class sizes to the daily use of technology, they are better prepared for the challenges of tertiary studies, as well as the ever-changing workplace of the future.Our matric learners write the IEB examinationsThe Independent Examinations Board (IEB) is an independent assessment board. Accredited by Umalusi, the board provides assessments in which the question style is deemed more challenging and comprehensive than it is in the National Senior Certificate final assessments. The final examinations set by the IEB are esteemed both locally and abroad, and prepare learners for the intense increase in workload during tertiary studies.Admissions Enquiries HereCurro Crescent, Groenvlei, Bloemfontein, 9301, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12.

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning.

Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

The Montessori program allows a child to develop at their own pace to reach independence, as the Educators follow the child's needs, sensitive periods and their stages of development.

Educators adapt learning methods to ""fit"" each child, instead of expecting each child to ""fit"" the system. We form bonds of trust and understanding with each child, fostering a secure, enjoyable learning environment.Daily academic routines include exclusive forms of neurological stimulation. Activities which enhance the subtle, often neglected, core motor skills are also a vital part of our curriculum. Audeamus strives to create and maintain a comfortable, family-like atmosphere.53 Annie Rd, River View, Emalahleni, 1039, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

In order to achieve this, it is  Da Silva Academy’s policy to expose its pupils to the various disciplines offered by the School: scholarship, sportsmanship and culture.The School views each of these disciplines as inherently important and as complementary components of a balanced, holistic education. We do not take the view that academic work is the only success criteria in the School. Although there is an emphasis on academic discipline and achievement, the importance of a balanced life style encompassing physical activity and wellbeing, as well as cultural involvement is impressed upon the learners and to this end they are expected to participate in the full school programme.Da Silva Academy prides itself on developing the individuality of each of its children and is fortunate in having small numbers, which allows this concentration of attention.Da Silva Academy strives to instil an ethos of high self-esteem, self-respect and well behaviour in all its pupils. These qualities are vital to allow every child to be the best that they can be.Ethos is defined as the characteristic spirit of a community, people or system. Every member of the School’s community contributes their own special gifts to make the School unique.Individual teachers, learners, parents and support staff become touched by the atmosphere pervading our independent School and the longevity of service of some of the staff is explained by their devotion to this Rustenburg institution.Monday7:00 am - 3:30 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals.
