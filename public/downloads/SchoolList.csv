CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/fleurhof-campus/Halite Road, Hyacinth Rd, Fleurhof, Randburg, 1709, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayClosedSundayClosed

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA.

However, the fundamentals of coding are formally introduced in our Grade 0 learning communities as detailed below. Robotics in the Pre-Preparatory phase is a 'hands on' approach to learning, where students build and design simple mechanisms from their environment whilst 'learning through play' with Lego Simple Machines. Whilst building activities range from spinning tops to racing cars, skills learnt involve an integration of Mathematics, Science and Linguistics. Coding skills are promoted through the use of the Sphero Bolt - a robotic ball that can be programmed to manoeuvre through specific paths, whilst displaying colour and sound effects.Rallim Preparatory | Cape Town, Deerhurst Drive, Sunningdale, Cape Town, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning.

Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary - High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning. Educators create learning activities that are motivational, technology-rich, and aligned to the needs of 21st century learners. Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence. As an Apple Distinguished and Google Apps for Education school, we use both platforms to provide a unique teaching and learning experience.

Each child's device becomes a personalised learning platform where its integration into learning and life becomes second nature. Throughout the College, learners engage in a variety of technology enriched activities through which they learn new concepts, practise and consolidate existing skills, create unique products, explore new ideas and pursue curiosities, engage in remediation and participate in enrichment.At Parklands College, educational technology and a high-tech collaborative environment has allowed our teachers to extend their lessons in innovative ways and encourage learners to develop global competencies by solving real world problems. Our teaching staff includes Apple and Google certified educators who share their expertise with colleagues, as well as teachers at other schools both locally and abroad.Programming is an essential digital literacy of the future, and design an essential skill.

The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic.

CAPS + Project based Learning (PBL) + IEB = FUTURE-PROOF FROM 18 MONTHS TO MATRIC
Pre-School:
The world of the child is full of sights and sounds which at first appear chaotic. From this chaos, the child must gradually create order; they slowly gain mastery of themselves and of their environment. Dr Montessori developed the “prepared environment” which possess a certain order and disposes the child to develop his capabilities at their own speed, according to his own capacities in a non-competitive atmosphere.Our safe and effective environment helps your child develop their physical, emotional, intellectual and spiritual capacities to the fullest. To achieve this, they must have freedom.In brief, the Montessori approach is designed to help the child build within themselves the foundations for a lifetime of creative learning and expression.Our staff have Montessori and/or ECD qualifications and are registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE).Primary – High School:
We teach the national CAPS curriculum that is integrated with Project-Based Learning from primary school level. We implement Project-Based Learning (PBL) from primary school right through to Grade 12.In Project Based Learning, the project is the vehicle for teaching the important knowledge and skills that a student needs to learn. The project contains and frames the curriculum and instruction.PBL requires critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and various forms of communication. To answer a Driving Question and create high-quality work, students need to do much more than remember information. They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%.

They need to use higher-order thinking skills and learn to work as a team.To help ensure our students are getting the main course and are engaging in quality Project Based Learning, We promote a research-based model for the students to learn how to question, investigate and/or design and respond to an authentic, engaging and complex question, problem and/or challenge.Our students write the Independent Examination Board (IEB) examinations in Grade 12. The IEB seeks to advance quality teaching and learning in South Africa through an assessment process of integrity, innovation and international comparability. All schools registered with the IEB to write the National Senior Certificate have access to a range of professional development opportunities as well as a variety of assessments, designed to serve a range of purposes.The IEB produces consistent, reliable results in the Grade 12 National Senior Certificate with an average pass rate between 97% and 98%. Furthermore, the IEB achieves between 78% and 80% pass with entry to degree study. Our first two cohorts of Matrics have achieved a 100% pass rate in the 2021 and 2022 IEB Matric Exams.Someday All Schools Will Teach This Way!For more and to see a virtual tour of our campus, visit https://futurenationschools.com/fleurhof-campus/Halite Road, Hyacinth Rd, Fleurhof, Randburg, 1709, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

It soon became known as the ""Black Eton"" where academic achievements were espoused. The list of the early alumni is impressive, the likes of Oliver Tambo, Fikile Bam and Hugh Masekela, as well as many of our former students, hold key positions in government and in large international corporations. The apartheid policies of the National Party regime put pressure on the school and it was closed in 1956.

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals. Every girl who has been a member of our school is known as a Rosie and is a part of the Rosie Family for life.Our VisionRooted in Christ's teaching of love for God, self and others, the family of St Teresa's School is committed to developing the values of compassion, service, love and respect in our girls. We aim to nurture and inspire responsible, enquiring young women who strive for excellence in all facets of life.18 Keyes Ave, Rosebank, Johannesburg, 2196, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Difficult decisions must often be made, with the only guideline being the fact that whatever choices we make, our children deserve only the best. At home, we ensure that the values we instil equip them for the future. It is, however, the time they spend with others - educators and friends that concern us most, for they are beyond our control.This is why the choice of a place or learning is possibly the most important decision any parent can make, as this decision will ultimately affect a Iearner's ability to succeed in life. At Parklands College, we offer complete peace of mind, not only preparing the child academically but also emotionally, socially, morally and physically, in preparation for life's challenges.""Reaching Outwards, Growing Minds, Building Futures""CHRISTOPHER ROBIN PRE-PRIMARY AND CRACKERJACKSGrades 0000 - R (12 months - 6 years)Christopher Robin Pre-Primary School was established in 1980 as a progressive and dynamic place of learning. It offers a nurturing, positive environment where children have a sense of belonging. Our pre-primary provides a safe and emotionally secure setting that encourages the development of the whole child: emotionally, socially, physically, and intellectually. With lots of time for uninterrupted, child-directed play, this is an opportunity for them to interact socially and engage with their friends. Exploration of a wide variety of equipment available for the children promotes healthy, physical bodies, developing flexibility, endurance, and strength. Playtime is also an important opportunity for children to become independent, develop confidence, and demonstrate creativity. We know that children begin to learn as soon as they are born, and that in the early years the foundation is laid for a child's future development and success. Building a child's physical, language, and social skills prepares him or her for the academic, cultural, and sporting opportunities offered in primary school. At Christopher Robin Pre-Primary we approach these goals with passion, care and commitment.PREPARATORYGrades 1-6We believe that effective teaching involves passion, knowledge, skill, discipline, motivation and care. Our educators foster high expectations of the learners and rigorously continue to promote the culture of excellence that pervades the very essence of our school. Our vision is one in which the holistic education of the individual goes beyond academic excellence. A healthy balance exists between the different spheres in our school whereby emphasis is placed on achievement on an individual and a collective level. This is achieved by the growth of self-esteem and the realisation of each individual's potential. We believe that innovative approaches and pioneering methods along with the acquisition of certain fundamental skills are necessary for the success of a school thereby ensuring that Parklands College continues to remain a forerunner in educational innovation.SECONDARYGrades 7-12The Secondary Faculty provides a distinctive academic experience for our learners. The academic programme gives each learner a firm grasp of fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, innovatively, and independently, and fosters a love of learning. Educators create learning activities that are motivational, technology-rich, and aligned to the needs of 21st century learners. Our educators offer a challenging and stimulating education in an achievement-focused culture. They are knowledgeable, enthusiastic and have high expectations of their learners. Each individual learner is valued, and student progress is closely monitored. The educators provide exceptional academic support, within the regular instructional programme and through additional tutorials that provide personalised learning support.The Secondary Faculty follows the national curriculum, with a wide spectrum of courses leading to the National Senior Certificate. We endeavour to ensure that the choice of subjects offered is as wide as possible, providing for the needs of each learner. It is this breadth and variety, along with an opportunity to pursue subjects of choice, which encourages our children to become life-long learners, seeing knowledge as intrinsically worthwhile. In addition to the required subjects, a number of enrichment subjects are offered, providing learners with a varied educational experience that satisfies individual interests.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGYParklands College has been recognised by Apple as an Apple Distinguished School (ADS) for its innovation, leadership and educational excellence.

In order to achieve this, it is  Da Silva Academy’s policy to expose its pupils to the various disciplines offered by the School: scholarship, sportsmanship and culture.The School views each of these disciplines as inherently important and as complementary components of a balanced, holistic education. We do not take the view that academic work is the only success criteria in the School. Although there is an emphasis on academic discipline and achievement, the importance of a balanced life style encompassing physical activity and wellbeing, as well as cultural involvement is impressed upon the learners and to this end they are expected to participate in the full school programme.Da Silva Academy prides itself on developing the individuality of each of its children and is fortunate in having small numbers, which allows this concentration of attention.Da Silva Academy strives to instil an ethos of high self-esteem, self-respect and well behaviour in all its pupils. These qualities are vital to allow every child to be the best that they can be.Ethos is defined as the characteristic spirit of a community, people or system. Every member of the School’s community contributes their own special gifts to make the School unique.Individual teachers, learners, parents and support staff become touched by the atmosphere pervading our independent School and the longevity of service of some of the staff is explained by their devotion to this Rustenburg institution.Monday7:00 am - 3:30 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

There was no government support of any kind for Catholic Schools so, of necessity, the school was private. With careful management and through the support of parents, the school was financially viable and was gradually able to extend its facilities along Keyes Ave to meet new needs. It was one of the first schools in the country to defy Apartheid laws and admit pupils of all races.The school has undergone various name changes from Rosebank Convent to St Teresa's Convent and finally today all three sections of the school are under one umbrella called St Teresa's School. The school caters for Grade 000 â€“ Grade 12. The Junior Primary is situated just down the road in Craighall Park, while the Senior Primary and the High School share the lovely grounds in Keyes Ave, the very street where the five pupils were taught over 92 years ago. While we have kept pace with the changes and challenges of our society, we have maintained the traditional values of service, faith, integrity, compassion and personal excellence. This spirituality expresses itself in service to others, especially those on the fringes of society.The professional staff are all qualified and compassionate members of staff. The school is managed by the Sisters of Mercy, the Board of Governors and the School Management Team. The school constantly achieves well academically and is in the top bracket of schools in the Gauteng Province. The school is a member of ISASA. Matrics write the IEB Senior Examination.Today, 90 years on, St Teresa's School is a much respected private school, proud of its unique tradition, its successes measured by the outstanding girls who have passed through its portals. Every girl who has been a member of our school is known as a Rosie and is a part of the Rosie Family for life.Our VisionRooted in Christ's teaching of love for God, self and others, the family of St Teresa's School is committed to developing the values of compassion, service, love and respect in our girls.

A group of intrepid church members felt that they needed to start a pre-school to serve the wider community of Pietermaritzburg. NCF Church embraced the idea of formal education on its land and endeavoured to assist. After 10 years of running a pre-school it was decided by Mrs W Fath (the first principal) to open a primary school. Since the first Grade 1 class of 1999 the school has experienced much positive growth. Mr B Mouton became the second principal in 2004. With a growing school and adjacent church it was decided to focus mainly on pre-school and junior primary from 2006. Since 2006 the focus of this school was to grow qualitatively and partner with neighbouring schools. Over the years the school added classrooms, sports fields and a swimming pool to its facilities. In June 2014 the school changed its name and badge, becoming Maritzburg Preparatory School. The school focuses on a qualitative approach to its foundation phase, and aims to be known for its love for children and its dedication as a team (staff, learners and parents) to giving the best all-round early education. Maritzburg Preparatory School, Alexandra Road, Westgate, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Montessori Method teaches children grace and courtesy, care of the environment and everyday practical life skills. Montessori also allows the children to develop and learn in all areas including language, mathematics, sensorial, botany, zoology and geography thus widening their knowledge and better preparing them for future education.97 Vorster Ave, Glenanda, Johannesburg, 2091, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Tertia King ontstaan. Sy het lang samesprekings met mnr. Johan Kruger gevoer, waarna besluit is om 'n loodskomitee te stig. Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand. Op 16 April 1996 open die skool met ongeveer 35 leerlinge op 'n perseel tussen Kempton Park en Benoni. Geboorte-en groeipyne spring die skool nie vry nie, maar ten spyte van diepliggende menslike verskille was daar tog die gevoel en baie sterk behoefte by ouers dat hulle graag hulle kinders in 'n privaatskool wil he, omdat die volgende waardes vir hulle belangrik is: Onderwerping aan die Skrif Kwaliteitonderrig Geborgenheid wat kleiner klassies meebring Gesonde dissipline Afrikaner-kultuurgebondenheid ?

The school is set in the country community of Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, near Bapsfontein, Gauteng East. The property of the school has been rezoned by the Ekurhuleni Municipality for use as a school. The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria. Secondly, there were a number of previously disadvantaged families who want good schooling for their children.Kaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaKaleidoscope School Impaq/Montessori, Pretorius Street, Nest Park XT1, Bapsfontein, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Charismatic movement affected this group, opening the way for a free move of the Holy Spirit amongst those who attended. Land that housed an old barn was purchased & converted into a church hall & the first pastoral couple were called to minister. Piet Retief Christian Church grew & the church building was extended to seat 250. After a church split in 1987, the numbers dwindled down to 70 people. In December 1988, the Lord brought Pastor Leonard & Dagmar to the church & within a year, God restored each member to the congregation. By 1991, the church building had become too small & the leadership began purchasing properties adjacent to the current building, allowing space for the new proposed building. In August 1997, the new church building was opened- a complete faith project & entirely debt-free! In 2002, the new building was extended & the seating capacity enlarged to 900.

Its roots stem from The Al Kalam Educational Society, which served learners in an extra mural academic assistance programme. Learners were assisted with skills development especially with regards to numeracy and literacy. A drug monitoring policy was developed in 2005 and the Stonefountain learners were expected to subject themselves to regular drug testing. This policy of drug testing proved very useful for many of the learners tested, tested positive for drug use and this explained their lack of progress at school. With an improvement of over 90% in drug use, the performance of learners soared and great success was achieved. This drug policy caught the eye of the Minister of Education, Grace Naledi Pandor, and the college drug policy has since become the benchmark for similar policies at all public schools across the country. In 2010, Stonefountain opened its second campus in Kenilworth as demand at the Athlone campus surpassed the available facilities there. It is indeed stimulating that schools like Stonefountain have found a special educational niche.

Our classrooms, stages, sports fields, boarding houses, Chapel and The Monastery outdoor centre are among the vibrant spaces where highly qualified staff work tirelessly to bring out the best in every individual.Here the girls learn about the value of hard work, perseverance, collaboration, sustainability, social justice and delayed gratification.There is something magical about the lifestyle on the DSG campus, probably thanks to the historic architecture, leafy gardens and peaceful smalltown landscape surrounding it. Full-time boarding enables DSG girls to be astonishingly productive and fully immersed in school life. They learn to appreciate the rich diversity of their peers, which
builds resilience and strengthens values of respect, humility, compassion and friendship. Such a busy school life can take its toll and girls are therefore monitored and supported by a Wellness Team that includes the resident pastoral staff in every house,
Chaplain, San sisters, educational psychologist and biokineticist.
We are proud to be custodians of our unique heritage while extending the legacy of the DSG through inclusive, future-minded education, in keeping with our motto ‘En Avant!’.DSG Junior - Grade 4-7DSG Senior - Grade 8-12Worcester St, Grahamstown, Makhanda, 6139, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 4:30 pmTuesdayN/AWednesdayN/AThursdayN/AFridayN/ASaturdayN/ASundayN/A

When the National Department of Education began to streamline the education system the board of Benoni Christian School, after consulting with parents, adopted the public school system's curriculum but added to it as the need arose. Since its inception, Benoni Christian School has had a 100 per cent matric pass rate.

Our aim is to grow the strong points and nurture the weak points of each child as well as to integrate therapies into learning time. At SOWLE Centre we are followers of Jesus.

He has been diagnosed with Down syndrome and his parents were struggling to find an appropriately stimulating learning environment for him. Sowle Centre evolved because we quickly realised that children with various special needs could also receive quality schooling, thanks to the skills that we developed from giving quality education to children with Down Syndrome. Our school caters for children who do not ""fit"" into remedial education classes as they are most conventionally classified. This is because these children may be more than two years behind in their development, but the unique environment and curriculum at our school afford the children the ability to learn through hands-on activities and play, rather than mainstream ""paper-based"" learning.95a Boden Rd, Jatniel, Benoni, 1509, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 5:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 5:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible.

As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully. This is still the heart of Kyrios.

Shortly after the school was built a school hall and church followed. By the mid-1950s, the school went up to standard six. One thousand children were taught in two shifts - the first ending at 1pm, and the second around 5.30pm. These children were fed too. In the 1960s the Sisters cooked each day in an enormous cauldron over an open fire.

Re-imagining education As educators who have more than 40 years of experience in both private and government schools, we have become concerned and disillusioned by a number of issues, such as: Traditional schooling is not meeting the needs of our children. Traditional schools focus on the curriculum and not the child. Private schools are profit-driven with hidden costs. Too many home schools are closing down. Class sizes are problematic. Teachers are not equipped, experienced or qualified. Too many children are being lost in these systems. Children are no longer the focus of education.

Christine's field of expertise is primary school and Andrew's focus has been high school and tertiary education. They are both passionate about education. The already well-documented big concerns about education in South Africa have been raised and discussed ad nauseum. There is no question that education is due a complete overhaul with a focus on skills rather than content. In a 21st century environment, where content is readily available through a variety of sources, the key to education is providing children with the skills to cope with this endless amount of content and to enable them to analyse and interpret the information and use it to change the environment around them.72 14th Ave, Edenvale, 1609, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Waldorf curriculum is an integrated Primary and High School system with the developmental stages of the child being the basis upon which subjects are introduced. The Main Lesson, which takes place in the first two hours of the school day when the children are at their most attentive, provides an in-depth exploration of any given subject. Each main lesson block lasts approximately four weeks, during which time children learn to approach the topic using all of their senses, to feel, think and experience the subject, making it their own.

Land that housed an old barn was purchased & converted into a church hall & the first pastoral couple were called to minister. Piet Retief Christian Church grew & the church building was extended to seat 250. After a church split in 1987, the numbers dwindled down to 70 people. In December 1988, the Lord brought Pastor Leonard & Dagmar to the church & within a year, God restored each member to the congregation. By 1991, the church building had become too small & the leadership began purchasing properties adjacent to the current building, allowing space for the new proposed building. In August 1997, the new church building was opened- a complete faith project & entirely debt-free! In 2002, the new building was extended & the seating capacity enlarged to 900.

This system of education is designed to take full advantage of the child's desire to learn and use his or her unique ability to develop their own capabilities. Our learning environment will help the child to develop physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally. Children choose their activities from open shelves with self-correcting materials and work in distinct work areas - on tables or on rugs on the floor. The practical life exercises enhance the development of task organization and cognitive order through care of self, care of the environment, exercises of grace and courtesy, and refinement of physical movement.

Passionate about creating a learning culture and developing a high level of literacy and numeracy amongst our learners, the teachers of Mount Sera Primary offer complementary after-school lessons in order to remediate, enrich and further support our learners' academic foundation. We believe that children are individuals. To this end we will provide quality education with a view to instilling a sense of personal responsibility and social consciousness that will enable learners to realize their full potential and become independent thinkers. This will be shaped by the principles of transformation, equity and Ubuntu.Mount Sera Primary, Heystek Street, Rustenburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Being fairly young and new to the profession it taught me a lot about teaching and forming relationships with learners and parents. In 1997 I transferred to Turffontein Primary school, first as teacher and within two years I was promoted to Principal. It was an immense challenge for me since the new school was a previous model C school and also the first truly multicultural school in the south of Johannesburg. While challenging at first I soon realized it gave me an opportunity to develop critical managerial skills which helped me to build bridges with the staff and the Gauteng Department of Education, and with parents and other stakeholders of the school.

competencies and character they may require to achieve their dreams and contribute to their local and global communities as 21st century women.
We prioritise staying abreast of the latest research on innovative education, but we also draw on the practical wisdom gained from a century and a half of institutional experience. DSG provides a safe, inclusive environment where girls can fearlessly
follow their curiosity and learn through discovery and critical thinking and even risk failure with no judgement and only learning as a consequence.
Therefore, we encourage girls to explore the full range of opportunities in academics, sports, the arts, culture, the outdoors, community engagement, travel and leadership.
Our classrooms, stages, sports fields, boarding houses, Chapel and The Monastery outdoor centre are among the vibrant spaces where highly qualified staff work tirelessly to bring out the best in every individual.Here the girls learn about the value of hard work, perseverance, collaboration, sustainability, social justice and delayed gratification.There is something magical about the lifestyle on the DSG campus, probably thanks to the historic architecture, leafy gardens and peaceful smalltown landscape surrounding it. Full-time boarding enables DSG girls to be astonishingly productive and fully immersed in school life. They learn to appreciate the rich diversity of their peers, which
builds resilience and strengthens values of respect, humility, compassion and friendship. Such a busy school life can take its toll and girls are therefore monitored and supported by a Wellness Team that includes the resident pastoral staff in every house,
Chaplain, San sisters, educational psychologist and biokineticist.
We are proud to be custodians of our unique heritage while extending the legacy of the DSG through inclusive, future-minded education, in keeping with our motto ‘En Avant!’.DSG Junior - Grade 4-7DSG Senior - Grade 8-12Worcester St, Grahamstown, Makhanda, 6139, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 4:30 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Our core values are Knowledge, Integrity, New Thought, Growth and Social Impact. (K.I.N.G.S.) We believe that the greatest knowledge someone should posses is a knowledge that they are fearfully and wonderfully created in the image of God. A person's value should stem from who they are, not what they do. Helping our learners discover the value that they carry as their primary identity is of first importance. All other knowledge is built upon this foundation. Integrity of heart forms one of the cornerstones for the development of steadfast personal character. We place a high value on integrity and respect for others in all of our interactions, whether in word or deed. It is the golden thread which weaves through the moral fabric of our lives, our families and our communities. All progress depends on the constant desire for and pursuit of new thought. We understand that we are preparing our learners for future jobs that do not yet exist and because of this we believe in encouraging curiosity and creativity in the manner in which we learn, use technology, and collaborate with those around us We desire to see meaningful growth in the life of every individual we interact with. By creating a positive environment which engages individuals in a journey of lifelong learning they are empowered to discover new areas for personal growth, be it in the classroom, on the sports field, on the stage performing, or in a leadership discussion. In line with our vision of being a blessing to the local community, the city, the nation of South Africa and the nations of the world, we place a high value on creating opportunities for individuals to make a difference by contributing to establishing hope, dignity and honour in the lives of all, in whatever way, small or large.

In particular Wendon Academy caters for the holistic educational needs of children who have learning barriers and who are not able to flourish in alternate educational schooling systems. In this educational context many of these children may manifest academic, behaviour problems and a lack of social integration which results in their marginalization, both during their school career and beyond. Wendon Academy was opened in January 2003 after its founders, Donald and Wendy Hicks took the initiative to set up a holistic, caring and high quality educational environment that would meet the specific needs of children with special needs. Their journey to 2003 had been one of personal experience and much research that was driven by their need to find a suitable educational context for the children that enter Wendon Academy. Mission Statement The aim of Wendon Academy is to develop happy, thinking, caring pupils who are equipped with the necessary knowledge and life skills to cope as balanced and confident individuals in their communities.22 High Wycombe Rd, Dawncrest, Westville, 3629, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Children choose their work from among the self-correcting materials displayed on open shelves, and they work in specific work areas. Over a period of time, the children develop into a ""normalized community,"" working with high concentration and few interruptions. Normalization is the process whereby a child moves from being undisciplined to self-disciplined, from disordered to ordered, from distracted to focused, through work in the environment. The process occurs through repeated work with materials that captivate the child's attention. For some children this inner change may take place quite suddenly, leading to deep concentration. In the Montessori preschool, academic competency is a means to an end, and the manipulatives are viewed as ""materials for development."" Practical life enhances the development of task organization and cognitive order through care of self, care of the environment, exercises of grace and courtesy, and coordination of physical movement.36 Petunia Street, Morgenzon, Mpumalanga, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

We provide an age-appropriate, child-centred curriculum ensuring that our children experience wide-ranging subject matter that gives them a real sense of the world in which they live. The Waldorf curriculum is an integrated Primary and High School system with the developmental stages of the child being the basis upon which subjects are introduced. The Main Lesson, which takes place in the first two hours of the school day when the children are at their most attentive, provides an in-depth exploration of any given subject. Each main lesson block lasts approximately four weeks, during which time children learn to approach the topic using all of their senses, to feel, think and experience the subject, making it their own. Their enthusiasm for learning can be seen in the quality of the self-made books that each student creates for the main lessons. ? ?

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand. Op 16 April 1996 open die skool met ongeveer 35 leerlinge op 'n perseel tussen Kempton Park en Benoni. Geboorte-en groeipyne spring die skool nie vry nie, maar ten spyte van diepliggende menslike verskille was daar tog die gevoel en baie sterk behoefte by ouers dat hulle graag hulle kinders in 'n privaatskool wil he, omdat die volgende waardes vir hulle belangrik is: Onderwerping aan die Skrif Kwaliteitonderrig Geborgenheid wat kleiner klassies meebring Gesonde dissipline Afrikaner-kultuurgebondenheid ?

When children and teenagers feel safe and valued, they will excel and realise their God given potential. Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well. It is more resilient and is growing stronger. Here we refer to our pastoral care, academics, extra-murals, staff development, financial controls, marketing and administration, maintenance and upgrades to our facilities. We are encouraged by our steady enrolments for 2023. Most importantly, our school remains debt free.

My passion is education and I have been involved in the profession for 32 years. I started out as a teacher at Klipspruit West Senior Secondary school. Being fairly young and new to the profession it taught me a lot about teaching and forming relationships with learners and parents. In 1997 I transferred to Turffontein Primary school, first as teacher and within two years I was promoted to Principal. It was an immense challenge for me since the new school was a previous model C school and also the first truly multicultural school in the south of Johannesburg. While challenging at first I soon realized it gave me an opportunity to develop critical managerial skills which helped me to build bridges with the staff and the Gauteng Department of Education, and with parents and other stakeholders of the school. During my time at Turffontein I felt privileged that I was able to create an exchange program with the UK Education Department through the British Council and I was invited to do a Master's programme in Educational Leadership at Harvard University in the USA. Ext 28, Cnr Tomato and, Kei St, Protea Glen, Soweto, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well.

They also feel that they have a say, and that their concerns are addressed. It is for these reasons that after having Grade 0 they asked for a Grade R to be implemented and thereafter asked for a full primary school. This has been completed with the addition of Grade in 2023. The 2023 staff compliment is 31 and the learner count is 310. Annually many learners are turned away due to limited capacity.

As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully. This is still the heart of Kyrios.

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand.

The emphasis is on skills development and independent study methods as opposed to the accumulation of facts by rote learning. The curriculum and school terms laid down by the Western Cape Education Department are followed. The content of the curriculum is presented from a Christian rather than a Humanistic viewpoint. English, Maths and Life Orientation are the core learning areas within the Foundation Phase at Mountain View Academy and all other learning areas are integrated within this programme.

The Montessori teaching methods and environment nurture and cultivate the pupil's instinctive need to understand, thus developing not only a mind that asks and questions, but one that loves to learn and test the answers offered by others, and to find answers to those questions for themselves. The definitive Montessori environment allows children of all ages to grow and develop both emotionally and intellectually, without being stereotyped or pressured to conform to the expectations of others. Each child is respected as an individual, and is taught the importance of valuing and respecting the individuality of both themselves and others. Multi-age groupings allow children to socialize with other children in different capacities and roles. Older children are allowed to develop leadership skills, whilst younger children are able to follow by example and drive their own motivation for learning.Randpark Ridge Montessori, Troupant Place, Randpark Ridge, Randburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

When children and teenagers feel safe and valued, they will excel and realise their God given potential. Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well. It is more resilient and is growing stronger. Here we refer to our pastoral care, academics, extra-murals, staff development, financial controls, marketing and administration, maintenance and upgrades to our facilities. We are encouraged by our steady enrolments for 2023. Most importantly, our school remains debt free.

Dr. Montessori initially worked with special needs children and was enormously successful in developing and applying teaching methods which aided their learning. Her educational methods were revolutionary in that they were based on the scientific observation of how children learnt. She did not merely impose traditional teaching methods which she felt restricted children realising their full potential. In particular the Montessori approach emphasises learning through all five senses and not only through the more traditional approaches of listening, watching and reading. Dr. Montessori's special needs children performed so successfully when they wrote the public school examinations that she subsequently founded a school in Rome called â€œCasa dei Bambiniâ€ (Children's House), where her teaching methods and principles were applied. Shortly thereafter two more Montessori schools were established and the word quickly spread about her successful teaching methods.7 Little Nook St, Sunningdale, Umhlanga, 4319, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The property of the school has been rezoned by the Ekurhuleni Municipality for use as a school. The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria.

The Waldorf curriculum is an integrated Primary and High School system with the developmental stages of the child being the basis upon which subjects are introduced. The Main Lesson, which takes place in the first two hours of the school day when the children are at their most attentive, provides an in-depth exploration of any given subject. Each main lesson block lasts approximately four weeks, during which time children learn to approach the topic using all of their senses, to feel, think and experience the subject, making it their own.

Its roots stem from The Al Kalam Educational Society, which served learners in an extra mural academic assistance programme. Learners were assisted with skills development especially with regards to numeracy and literacy. A drug monitoring policy was developed in 2005 and the Stonefountain learners were expected to subject themselves to regular drug testing. This policy of drug testing proved very useful for many of the learners tested, tested positive for drug use and this explained their lack of progress at school. With an improvement of over 90% in drug use, the performance of learners soared and great success was achieved. This drug policy caught the eye of the Minister of Education, Grace Naledi Pandor, and the college drug policy has since become the benchmark for similar policies at all public schools across the country. In 2010, Stonefountain opened its second campus in Kenilworth as demand at the Athlone campus surpassed the available facilities there. It is indeed stimulating that schools like Stonefountain have found a special educational niche. Schools like Stonefountain independent schools charging modest fees should be drawn on to assist innovation in public schools.8 Warrington Rd, Claremont, Cape Town, 7708, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

A group of intrepid church members felt that they needed to start a pre-school to serve the wider community of Pietermaritzburg. NCF Church embraced the idea of formal education on its land and endeavoured to assist. After 10 years of running a pre-school it was decided by Mrs W Fath (the first principal) to open a primary school. Since the first Grade 1 class of 1999 the school has experienced much positive growth. Mr B Mouton became the second principal in 2004. With a growing school and adjacent church it was decided to focus mainly on pre-school and junior primary from 2006. Since 2006 the focus of this school was to grow qualitatively and partner with neighbouring schools. Over the years the school added classrooms, sports fields and a swimming pool to its facilities. In June 2014 the school changed its name and badge, becoming Maritzburg Preparatory School. The school focuses on a qualitative approach to its foundation phase, and aims to be known for its love for children and its dedication as a team (staff, learners and parents) to giving the best all-round early education.Maritzburg Preparatory School, Alexandra Road, Westgate, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully.

We believe that all children are capable of teaching as well as learning, and we take cognisance of this in all our interactions with our students. Our focus, therefore, is on developing the individual, not in moulding them into the strictures of conformity or the traditions of an institution, expecting them to perform in areas they are clearly not suited to. Too often we have seen the breakdown of a child's self-esteem, the labels that are attached and the medication unnecessarily administered to keep a child from disrupting a class environment unable to nurture and contain them. We at Chartwell have a group of highly professional and dedicated teachers to help ensure that all students receive the attention they need to fulfil their true potential. ?88 5th Street Chartwell, Chartwell, 2055, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Learning Programmes and activities are planned in such a way to maximize the child's development. What a child thinks of him/herself influences everything they do; they need assurance that they are special and worthwhile as individuals. Education is a three-way process between the parent, teacher, and child: We, therefore, work closely with parents in the intellectual, emotional and social development of the child.
