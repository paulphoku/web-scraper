Montessori Learning Areas There are several learning areas in the Montessori environment. These overlap with and correspond to the requirements of the Department of Education. Montessori education uses didactic materials, which are materials to assist concept formation and also to help achieve mastery of certain concepts.

In 1992 the school moved to its present site in Myngenoegen; 9 hectares of naturally beautiful ground with over one hundred indigenous trees.

Its roots stem from The Al Kalam Educational Society, which served learners in an extra mural academic assistance programme. Learners were assisted with skills development especially with regards to numeracy and literacy. A drug monitoring policy was developed in 2005 and the Stonefountain learners were expected to subject themselves to regular drug testing. This policy of drug testing proved very useful for many of the learners tested, tested positive for drug use and this explained their lack of progress at school. With an improvement of over 90% in drug use, the performance of learners soared and great success was achieved. This drug policy caught the eye of the Minister of Education, Grace Naledi Pandor, and the college drug policy has since become the benchmark for similar policies at all public schools across the country. In 2010, Stonefountain opened its second campus in Kenilworth as demand at the Athlone campus surpassed the available facilities there. It is indeed stimulating that schools like Stonefountain have found a special educational niche.

A few years later in 1911, St Peter's Priory and College were added, offering a boarding-based high school education to the young men who came from the length and breadth of South Africa. It soon became known as the ""Black Eton"" where academic achievements were espoused. The list of the early alumni is impressive, the likes of Oliver Tambo, Fikile Bam and Hugh Masekela, as well as many of our former students, hold key positions in government and in large international corporations. The apartheid policies of the National Party regime put pressure on the school and it was closed in 1956. However, the Anglican Church ensured that education continued in this attractive part of southern Johannesburg. The buildings reopened for business in 1958 when St Martin's School was born.

Our merit system focuses on balanced positive discipline. At Rooha we are focused on developing the child holistically. Our well-prepared pre-primary lessons are based on the (CAPS) curriculum of the Department of Education of the Western Cape where we are also registered. Progress reports are issued each term. We also run the ELit and RMaths program from the Department. At Rooha we believe children learn through playing. We make enough time for free play indoors as well as outdoors. A new interesting theme is covered each week to broaden our children's knowledge. Every week we also work through a music lesson as well as a movement lesson to provide for our children's auditory and physical requirements. Every day we discuss the weekly theme: a Bible story; the weather; maths; language and life orientation. We also engage our creativity through singing and performing other creative activities.Rooha, Panorama Drive, The Links, Cape Town, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
