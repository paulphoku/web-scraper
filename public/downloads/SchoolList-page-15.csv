Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well.

People involved with the school feel it a program that addresses their needs and is fully focused on uplifting the previously disadvantaged members. They also feel that they have a say, and that their concerns are addressed. It is for these reasons that after having Grade 0 they asked for a Grade R to be implemented and thereafter asked for a full primary school. This has been completed with the addition of Grade in 2023. The 2023 staff compliment is 31 and the learner count is 310. Annually many learners are turned away due to limited capacity. The National Lottery has been instrumental in our ability to expand by funding the program three times. The focus is to uplift an underprivileged community and we therefore have to make it affordable to them. This means that outside sponsorship/funding is necessary for the continuation of the work.

We have grown so much in the past few years that we have had to buy the neighbouring property and build on twice to cope with the growing numbers of learners and the demand that exists for registered nursery schools. We have massive grassy playgrounds for the baby/toddler and the bigger children's side of the school, this is our biggest asset as parents love the fact that their children have a large area in which to run and play during the day - ensuring a long peaceful sleep at night!
