This system of education is designed to take full advantage of the child's desire to learn and use his or her unique ability to develop their own capabilities. Our learning environment will help the child to develop physically, cognitively, socially and emotionally. Children choose their activities from open shelves with self-correcting materials and work in distinct work areas - on tables or on rugs on the floor. The practical life exercises enhance the development of task organization and cognitive order through care of self, care of the environment, exercises of grace and courtesy, and refinement of physical movement.

Phyllis Jowell was truly a woman of valour who strongly supported Torah learning and Jewish continuity during her lifetime. Phyllis lived her life by the motto of Veahavta Leraiacha Komacha 'love your fellow as yourself' - in which the essence of her life was what she selflessly did for others. Her inspiration continues to ensure young children being educated in a Torah-inspired environment. Our logo is a picture of a Torah, open for all to see. This reflects our goal of educating our children to access and apply fundamental and timeless laws, lessons and values of our Torah to their lives in a dynamic and modern world. This vision is also beautifully encapsulated in our motto of ""Torah Im Derech Eretz"".

My passion is education and I have been involved in the profession for 32 years. I started out as a teacher at Klipspruit West Senior Secondary school. Being fairly young and new to the profession it taught me a lot about teaching and forming relationships with learners and parents. In 1997 I transferred to Turffontein Primary school, first as teacher and within two years I was promoted to Principal. It was an immense challenge for me since the new school was a previous model C school and also the first truly multicultural school in the south of Johannesburg. While challenging at first I soon realized it gave me an opportunity to develop critical managerial skills which helped me to build bridges with the staff and the Gauteng Department of Education, and with parents and other stakeholders of the school. During my time at Turffontein I felt privileged that I was able to create an exchange program with the UK Education Department through the British Council and I was invited to do a Master's programme in Educational Leadership at Harvard University in the USA.Ext 28, Cnr Tomato and, Kei St, Protea Glen, Soweto, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
