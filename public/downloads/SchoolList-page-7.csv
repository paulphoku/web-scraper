Our aim is to grow the strong points and nurture the weak points of each child as well as to integrate therapies into learning time. At SOWLE Centre we are followers of Jesus. We seek to show love, care and respect to everyone. We meet every challenge by growing and learning together. Sowle Centre began because of a little boy ready to enter reception year in January 2011. He has been diagnosed with Down syndrome and his parents were struggling to find an appropriately stimulating learning environment for him. Sowle Centre evolved because we quickly realised that children with various special needs could also receive quality schooling, thanks to the skills that we developed from giving quality education to children with Down Syndrome. Our school caters for children who do not ""fit"" into remedial education classes as they are most conventionally classified. This is because these children may be more than two years behind in their development, but the unique environment and curriculum at our school afford the children the ability to learn through hands-on activities and play, rather than mainstream ""paper-based"" learning.95a Boden Rd, Jatniel, Benoni, 1509, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 5:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 5:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 5:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 5:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Principal of the School, Carol Gardner, who has resided in the area since 1995, realized the need for a school in the area for two reasons: Firstly, the closest primary school is approximately 20km away. There are many young families with children either in, or moving into Nestpark Agricultural Holdings, who do not not wish to or cannot afford to travel 20km every day to take their children to school. For this reason, the school fees have been kept as low as possible. Considering that it is a small private school, the fees are well below those of other private schools in the surrounding areas of Benoni and Pretoria.
