As busy ""business owning"" parents who care deeply about their children, they needed to find the best possible solution. They decided to employ a teacher to home-school their son. This turned out to be a successful endeavour as their son's results and his attitude improved significantly. It became apparent that sometimes so called ""difficult or impossible"" kids who are often rejected by other institutions simply required more individual attention and adapted engagement methods that are not readily available in larger schools with high density classrooms. Soon there were requests from friends to join the home-schooling group, and as they realised that most of these kids were desperate, they allowed them to join. The result: for the 2011 school year the six matric pupils in the school all passed successfully. This is still the heart of Kyrios.

The parish and school were established in 1946 by the Oblates of Mary. The original school building, one of the oldest in Orlando West, served as a school during the week and a church on Sunday. Shortly after the school was built a school hall and church followed. By the mid-1950s, the school went up to standard six. One thousand children were taught in two shifts - the first ending at 1pm, and the second around 5.30pm. These children were fed too. In the 1960s the Sisters cooked each day in an enormous cauldron over an open fire. From 1947 the school had catered for primary school children, but in 2003 it was decided that Soweto needed another Catholic high school, and St. Martin's was the chosen site. In 2006 St. Martin de Porres High School saw its first Matric Class which achieved a 100% pass rate in the final exams. The school continues to perform well, consistently recognised by the school district for its excellence in education. Aiken St, Port Shepstone, 4240, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

Education is brought to life at Seren House Cottage School. Education is far more than a syllabus or a textbook. Each child is taught the way they learn. School should not be the focus of family life. Seren House is built on 4 pillars: Honesty, Kindness, Loyalty and Diligence. Re-imagining education As educators who have more than 40 years of experience in both private and government schools, we have become concerned and disillusioned by a number of issues, such as: Traditional schooling is not meeting the needs of our children. Traditional schools focus on the curriculum and not the child. Private schools are profit-driven with hidden costs. Too many home schools are closing down. Class sizes are problematic. Teachers are not equipped, experienced or qualified. Too many children are being lost in these systems. Children are no longer the focus of education. What we offer Exclusive education up to Grade 12. Qualified and experienced teachers. Focus is the heart of the child. No uniforms. No textbooks. No homework. 24 hour access to the staff.

Originally the school had a strong art focus and a large studio space set aside for the children, giving the school its name. Since then, the school has grown and matured, and today is a highly respected, parent-owned Montessori school for children aged 2-6. Year after year families entrust us with their children's early education, with many siblings, cousins and neighbors joining each other in the classrooms. We even have a number of parents who attended the school themselves as children now enrolling their own children, a testament to the great foundation they received that they hope to pass on to their own children. At The Children's Studio each child is encouraged to build a solid foundation of learning, respect and self-confidence. This gives them the opportunity to reach their full potential.
