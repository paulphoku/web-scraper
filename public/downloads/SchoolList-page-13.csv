In this educational context many of these children may manifest academic, behaviour problems and a lack of social integration which results in their marginalization, both during their school career and beyond. Wendon Academy was opened in January 2003 after its founders, Donald and Wendy Hicks took the initiative to set up a holistic, caring and high quality educational environment that would meet the specific needs of children with special needs. Their journey to 2003 had been one of personal experience and much research that was driven by their need to find a suitable educational context for the children that enter Wendon Academy.

Children choose their work from among the self-correcting materials displayed on open shelves, and they work in specific work areas. Over a period of time, the children develop into a ""normalized community,"" working with high concentration and few interruptions. Normalization is the process whereby a child moves from being undisciplined to self-disciplined, from disordered to ordered, from distracted to focused, through work in the environment. The process occurs through repeated work with materials that captivate the child's attention. For some children this inner change may take place quite suddenly, leading to deep concentration. In the Montessori preschool, academic competency is a means to an end, and the manipulatives are viewed as ""materials for development."" Practical life enhances the development of task organization and cognitive order through care of self, care of the environment, exercises of grace and courtesy, and coordination of physical movement.36 Petunia Street, Morgenzon, Mpumalanga, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

The Waldorf curriculum is an integrated Primary and High School system with the developmental stages of the child being the basis upon which subjects are introduced. The Main Lesson, which takes place in the first two hours of the school day when the children are at their most attentive, provides an in-depth exploration of any given subject. Each main lesson block lasts approximately four weeks, during which time children learn to approach the topic using all of their senses, to feel, think and experience the subject, making it their own. Their enthusiasm for learning can be seen in the quality of the self-made books that each student creates for the main lessons. ? ?

Happy children are active children and with our amalgamation of methodologies from traditional to modern, all learning is conducted with creativity and fun. Perspective Happy and active children are creative children who are willing to learn. All our programmes are designed to stimulate learning through the five senses; smell, touch, hear, taste and seeing. Cognitive stimulation of the mind is also important, and this is achieved through imagination, creative thinking, social interaction and most of all learning through play and fun. With a vast and varied teaching experience, we will be creating a learning environment based largely on the Montessori education principles. Fun, Learning, Friends and Creativity! Our community: At The Little Ashford Preschool (""The LAP""), we aim to offer the best learning exposure and environment to our children. To a large extent this is achieved by aiming for a teacher/assistant to children ratio of 1:10 on the upper end. For our younger group we feel that a ratio of 1:5 will enable us to provide the personal touch and care this group requires.

Die doel van hierdie komitee was om na die lewensvatbaarheid van so 'n skool te kyk. Op 20 Februarie 1996 vind daar 'n vergadering in die kategesesaal van die NG Kerk in Kempton Kruin plaas. Die eerste voorlopige bestuursraad word op 7 Maart 1996 verkies met mnr. Johan Kruger as voorsitter. Daar word besluit dat die skool bekend sal staan as Privaatskool Oos-Rand. Op 16 April 1996 open die skool met ongeveer 35 leerlinge op 'n perseel tussen Kempton Park en Benoni. Geboorte-en groeipyne spring die skool nie vry nie, maar ten spyte van diepliggende menslike verskille was daar tog die gevoel en baie sterk behoefte by ouers dat hulle graag hulle kinders in 'n privaatskool wil he, omdat die volgende waardes vir hulle belangrik is: Onderwerping aan die Skrif Kwaliteitonderrig Geborgenheid wat kleiner klassies meebring Gesonde dissipline Afrikaner-kultuurgebondenheid ?

Children both locally and from afar, especially Africa, would be sent to the school. The Lord laid upon the hearts of Dimitri and Colleen Cristallides the desire to establish an unique rainbow school which integrates a nursery section, pre-primary and primary school in the Goodwood area. Hope Of Africa Junior Christian College is an unique school in that it has its own character and endevours to empower its children spiritually, academically and physically according to the teachings of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. Our dedicated and qualified staff strive to foster a positive attitude amongst the children towards their scholastic work and their peers. It is not only the right but also the responsibility of the parents to be involved in the child's school programme. A healthy and active parent-to-teacher partnership is therefore encouraged. 82 Wellington St, Vasco Estate, Cape Town, 7460, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed

When children and teenagers feel safe and valued, they will excel and realise their God given potential. Our philosophy is that we do not have 400 pupils; rather we have 'one pupil x 400,' and each pupil is our most important.' We know each child by name.Assumption Convent provides excellent education. For the past 5 years, our matrics have achieved a 100% university pass rate, and have consistently scored above the IEB average in all subjects. Wits University has recognised our school as one of their top 10 feeder schools in South Africa. Our past pupils go on to excel at local and at overseas universities, and thereafter successfully pursue a very wide range of professions in the humanities, sciences and in the world of business.Apart from academics, we passionately believe that authentic education must be holistic, and nurture body, mind and spirit; and we therefore offer a comprehensive programme of sports and cultural activities. We believe that some of the most important values and life skills are 'caught rather than taught.' Our goal is to inculcate selflessness, kindness, integrity, empathy, and a sense of duty. Our pupils must have the ability to work both independently, and as part of a team. They must demonstrate determination and grit, hard work, the ability to communicate well, to problem solve, to be flexible, to interpret and discern the truth from fake news, and so much more. Assumption Convent has done its job well when its grade 12 leavers are well-balanced, confident, kind young ladies with strong Christian values, and a desire to serve their fellow human beings.Looking to the future:The World Bank Governor, David Malpass has recently warned of the dangers the global economy still faces just two years after Covid-19 caused the deepest recession since the Second World War. This time, he says the global economy is facing the highest price increases in decades, combined with low or even negative growth.Whilst the independent schools sector, has been particularly hard hit, Assumption Convent is weathering this storm remarkably well. It is more resilient and is growing stronger. Here we refer to our pastoral care, academics, extra-murals, staff development, financial controls, marketing and administration, maintenance and upgrades to our facilities. We are encouraged by our steady enrolments for 2023. Most importantly, our school remains debt free. We can unequivocally state that our special school is as 'Fully Alive,' as it has ever been.Mullins Rd, Malvern East, Germiston, 1401, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
