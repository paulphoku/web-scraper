competencies and character they may require to achieve their dreams and contribute to their local and global communities as 21st century women.
We prioritise staying abreast of the latest research on innovative education, but we also draw on the practical wisdom gained from a century and a half of institutional experience. DSG provides a safe, inclusive environment where girls can fearlessly
follow their curiosity and learn through discovery and critical thinking and even risk failure with no judgement and only learning as a consequence.
Therefore, we encourage girls to explore the full range of opportunities in academics, sports, the arts, culture, the outdoors, community engagement, travel and leadership.
Our classrooms, stages, sports fields, boarding houses, Chapel and The Monastery outdoor centre are among the vibrant spaces where highly qualified staff work tirelessly to bring out the best in every individual.Here the girls learn about the value of hard work, perseverance, collaboration, sustainability, social justice and delayed gratification.There is something magical about the lifestyle on the DSG campus, probably thanks to the historic architecture, leafy gardens and peaceful smalltown landscape surrounding it. Full-time boarding enables DSG girls to be astonishingly productive and fully immersed in school life. They learn to appreciate the rich diversity of their peers, which
builds resilience and strengthens values of respect, humility, compassion and friendship. Such a busy school life can take its toll and girls are therefore monitored and supported by a Wellness Team that includes the resident pastoral staff in every house,
Chaplain, San sisters, educational psychologist and biokineticist.

We pride ourselves on enhancing spelling, reading, and comprehension in all subjects. We aim to provide quality education. We do not label the learners and are constantly encouraging them to grow and develop in all aspects of their lives. A strong work ethic is promoted and rewarded. Some of our learners are mainstreamed, some remain with us for the duration of their primary school years or up to grade 9 and some are redirected to LSEN schools. Each child follows his/her unique path. We involve educational psychologists, speech therapists, and occupational therapists to facilitate the child's development.

Our core values are Knowledge, Integrity, New Thought, Growth and Social Impact. (K.I.N.G.S.) We believe that the greatest knowledge someone should posses is a knowledge that they are fearfully and wonderfully created in the image of God. A person's value should stem from who they are, not what they do. Helping our learners discover the value that they carry as their primary identity is of first importance. All other knowledge is built upon this foundation. Integrity of heart forms one of the cornerstones for the development of steadfast personal character. We place a high value on integrity and respect for others in all of our interactions, whether in word or deed. It is the golden thread which weaves through the moral fabric of our lives, our families and our communities. All progress depends on the constant desire for and pursuit of new thought. We understand that we are preparing our learners for future jobs that do not yet exist and because of this we believe in encouraging curiosity and creativity in the manner in which we learn, use technology, and collaborate with those around us We desire to see meaningful growth in the life of every individual we interact with. By creating a positive environment which engages individuals in a journey of lifelong learning they are empowered to discover new areas for personal growth, be it in the classroom, on the sports field, on the stage performing, or in a leadership discussion.
