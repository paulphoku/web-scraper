The emphasis is on skills development and independent study methods as opposed to the accumulation of facts by rote learning. The curriculum and school terms laid down by the Western Cape Education Department are followed. The content of the curriculum is presented from a Christian rather than a Humanistic viewpoint. English, Maths and Life Orientation are the core learning areas within the Foundation Phase at Mountain View Academy and all other learning areas are integrated within this programme.

PEPPS was founded by Patrick Hamilton and his wife, Toni. Patrick was PEPPS director and Toni was Director: Public Relations, in charge of fundraising. Patrick was the Headmaster of WHPS Preparatory School in Pretoria. The original vision of PEPPS was to establish multi-racial, affordable, private schools which offered quality education. In 1990 parents from the then Pietersburg, having heard of the Project which had already established schools in Edenvale and Atteridgeville, approached Patrick Hamilton to open a PEPPS in town. PEPPS Polokwane was established in 1991 in a house in Koppiefontein. In 1992 the school moved to its present site in Myngenoegen; 9 hectares of naturally beautiful ground with over one hundred indigenous trees. In 1994 growing demand lead to the extension of the primary school to Grade 9 and in 1996 the school was further extended to incorporate Grade 12.PEPPS Schools Mokopane, Mahwelereng-B, South Africa, South AfricaMonday7:00 am - 3:00 pmTuesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmWednesday7:00 am - 3:00 pmThursday7:00 am - 3:00 pmFriday7:00 am - 3:00 pmSaturdayClosedSundayClosed
